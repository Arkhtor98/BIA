        "College presidents across the USA recognized a need to track how student-athletes are doing academically prior to graduation. Therefore, they implemeted a comprehensive academic refore package designed to improve the academic success and graduation of all student-athletes. The centerpiece of the academic reform package was the development of a real-time academic measurement for sports teams, known as the Academic Progress Rate (APR).\n",

Since its inception, the APR has become an important measure of student-athlete academic success. Additionally, student-athletes can be ruled ineligible to play if they demonstrate poor academic performances.\n",
